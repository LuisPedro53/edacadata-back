# Project EducaData

Welcome !
This is the backend of the EducaData Project, created entirely by me. A crud where it is possible to search, delete, create and update students.

## Tecnologies Used

## A Little Bit of Each Technology

Creating a project using the following technologies was an incredibly enriching experience:

- **GraphQL**: GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and the same structure of the data is returned from the server. This leads to less data being transferred over the network and a more efficient application.

- **Express**: Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, making it a popular choice for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

- **SQL Server**: Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports a wide variety of transaction processing, business intelligence, and analytics applications in corporate IT environments. It’s one of the three market-leading database technologies, along with Oracle Database and IBM’s DB2.

## How to run the project

After cloning the repository, make sure Docker is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Docker website.

Once Docker is installed, follow these steps to run the project:


1. Bring down any old versions of the project that might be running with the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```
2. Build the Docker Compose project with the following command:

```
docker-compose build
```
3. Build the Docker Compose project with the following command:

```
docker-compose up

```
4. After executing the above commands, at the end of the image installation and subsequent execution, the terminal will display the following messages:

```
Conectado ao banco de dados

```
```
Server is running on port 8080

```
4. Make sure the server (EducaData-Back) is running on port 8080.

5. To check if the server is running, type in your browser: 

```
localhost:8080/graphql
```

6. If the graphical part of graphql appears, then the server is running correctly


## Conclusion

In summary, each of these technologies played a vital role in the project, contributing to its success. The combination of these tools resulted in clean, efficient, and secure code. It was a valuable learning journey that will surely have a positive impact on future projects.
